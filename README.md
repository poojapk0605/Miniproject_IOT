# IoT Project: MQTT and CoAP with VM and Raspberry Pi

Conducted a project to explore MQTT and CoAP protocols using both virtual (VM) and physical (Raspberry Pi 5) implementations. Initially tested on a VM environment as a subscriber (sub) and local machine as a publisher (pub), then transitioned to physical hardware.

## Project Overview

This project involved:
- Setting up a virtual environment (VM) to simulate MQTT and CoAP communication.
- Writing a script to generate 30 values with different QoS for MQTT and CoAP protocols.
- Transitioning to physical hardware (Raspberry Pi 5) for real-world testing and validation.

## Key Components

- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Used as a subscriber to simulate MQTT and CoAP protocols.
- **Raspberry Pi 5**: Deployed as a publisher to implement and test MQTT and CoAP in a physical IoT setup.
- **Scripting**: Developed scripts to generate simulated data and test protocol functionalities.
- **MQTT and CoAP**: Implemented both protocols with varying Quality of Service (QoS) levels for data transmission.

## Project Highlights

- Conducted initial virtual testing with VM setup.
- Scripted data generation for MQTT and CoAP protocols.
- Transitioned to Raspberry Pi 5 for physical implementation and testing.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **IoT Protocols**: Hands-on experience with MQTT and CoAP, including QoS implementation.
- **Virtualization**: Setup and configuration of VM environment for protocol simulation.
- **Physical IoT Deployment**: Integration and testing of protocols on Raspberry Pi 4.
